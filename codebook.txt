A description of the study by the authors is given below: 

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers 
within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded 
accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 
3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have 
been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has 
been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was 
selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by 
applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows 
of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration 
signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated 
using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components,
 therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window,
 a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time 
and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

==================================================================

The tidy data set submitted contains summary information (means)
of 66 measurements for each person in the data set by activity. 
Only those measurements representing a computed mean or standard
deviation (i.e. they contained mean() or std() were analyzed.)

The following are activity labels corresponding to column 2
in the tidy data set. 

1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

The following are the variables (columns) contained in the tidy dataset. 
Each of the variables 3 through 68 represents the mean of all observations 
for each subject and each activity.
